                <h2>The beginning</h2>
                <p>Jeremiah is a high school student from Clearwater who's been getting into coding over the past year. He started by messing around with free online tutorials and eventually got hooked on building simple websites and automating small tasks. Between school, a part-time job, and helping out at home, he tries to carve out time each week to learn more about programming. He recently joined his school's tech club and is hoping to find a summer internship, even if it's unpaid, just to get some experience. Jeremiah's not exactly sure what kind of developer he wants to be yet, but he knows he wants a future in tech and is doing what he can to get there.
